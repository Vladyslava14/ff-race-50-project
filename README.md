# Race Participants Dashboard â€“ Power BI & SQL Project

This project explores ultramarathon participant data using SQL, Python, and Power BI. The goal is to understand how age, gender, start time, and location impact race performance.

---

##  Key Insights

- The **average race completion time** is **761.87 minutes**, serving as a benchmark for comparing different age and gender groups.

- The majority of participants are **male (77.8%)**, as shown in the gender distribution pie chart.

- The **peak starting hour is 1:00 PM (13:00)**, possibly reflecting scheduling preferences or strategic performance choices.

- **Younger participants** generally have **slightly faster average finish times**, based on the line chart visualizing Average Time by Age.

**Data Source**: [UltraSignup - FF Race 50](https://ultrasignup.com/results_event.aspx?did=102259)  
**Data Origin**: SQL Server (`FF_Race50DB.dbo.ff_race_2.0`)  
**Data Cleaning**: [`MyCleanedData.ipynb`](MyCleanedData.ipynb)

## Dashboard Features (Power BI)

The Power BI report includes:

- **Pie Chart**: Gender distribution  
- **Line Chart**: Count of participants by hour  
- **Histogram**: Age distribution (age binning)  
- **Line Chart**: Average finish time by age  
- **Bar Chart**: Participant count by age group  
- **Interactive Slicers**: Gender, City, Age

##  Data Cleaning 

The Jupyter Notebook `MyCleanedData.ipynb` was used to:

- Remove missing or inconsistent entries  
- Convert time formats to minutes  
- Standardize column names  
- Create derived columns (e.g., `Time_minutes`, `Age group`)  
- Export cleaned data for Power BI and SQL

##  SQL Data Exploration

### Sample queries:

- **How many U.S. states were represented?**
  ```sql
  SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT State) FROM ff_race_2.0
  ```

- **Average time by gender:**
  ```sql
  SELECT Gender, AVG(Time_minutes) FROM ff_race_2.0 GROUP BY Gender
  ```

- **Youngest and oldest runners by gender:**
  ```sql
  SELECT Gender, MIN(Age), MAX(Age) FROM ff_race_2.0 GROUP BY Gender
  ```

- **Average time per age group:**
  ```sql
  WITH ageBuckets AS (
    SELECT Time_minutes,
      CASE 
        WHEN Age < 30 THEN 'age_20-29'
        WHEN Age < 40 THEN 'age_30-39'
        WHEN Age < 50 THEN 'age_40-49'
        WHEN Age < 60 THEN 'age_50-59'
        ELSE 'age_60+' 
      END AS age_group
    FROM ff_race_2.0
  )
  SELECT age_group, AVG(Time_minutes) FROM ageBuckets GROUP BY age_group
  ```

- **Top 3 fastest males and females:**
  ```sql
  WITH gender_rank AS (
    SELECT RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY Gender ORDER BY Time_minutes ASC) AS gender_rank,
           Name, Gender, Time_minutes
    FROM ff_race_2.0
  )
  SELECT * FROM gender_rank WHERE gender_rank < 4 ORDER BY Time_minutes
  ```

##  Tools Used

- Microsoft Power BI  
- SQL Server (T-SQL)  
- Jupyter Notebook (Python, Pandas)  
- Power Query Editor  
- DAX (for time measures)

---

## Objective

To analyze race performance across demographic groups, identify the fastest participants, and gain insights into how age and gender impact finish times.
